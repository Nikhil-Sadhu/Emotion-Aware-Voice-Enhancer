## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Feature Extraction
- Extract MFCCs, Chroma, Mel Spectrogram, ZCR, and RMSE from voice clips.

### 2. Emotion Classification
- Trained an SVM model on voice data with emotional labels.
- Saved model and scaler using `joblib`.

### 3. Voice Transformation
- Apply pitch shifting, time stretching, and effects like tremolo.
- Choose between:
  - `Emotion Mode`: enhances detected emotion (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
  - `Voice Mode`: transforms voice style (robot, girl, boy, chipmunk, etc.)

### 4. Web Interface
- Built with Gradio: record → enhance → play → download.
